  this is normal text with one tab and (\n)

      this is text with 3 tabs
    this is text with 2 tabs and \n

    this is text with 2 tabs and \n
      this is text with 3 tabs without \n

      this is text 3 with \n
this is text without any tab
        this is text with 4 tabs and \n
      3 tab without \n
    2 tab without \n
  1 tab without \n
0 tab without \n

this mean using 0 or 1 tab is for normal text

to separate lines use empty line between them
    
    use 2 tabs and add empty line above to convert normal text to text can copy and structe
    then you can structer text like a code in code editor
      and this is amazing

      wow this is amazing
